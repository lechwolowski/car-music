Imagine, you work at a company that wants to build a personalized music service which plays tracks depending on a few variables: user, weather, mood, road type, etc.  
The project is currently in a very initial stage, and you got the task to:
* prepare a model (ML, using sklearn) and an initial version of a recommender service (return a list of recommended tracks based on an input data)
* write a few unit tests
* containerize the application with Docker
* write user manual on how to test and run the service.  
#### Bonus points:
* build a simple, minimal REST service providing predictions based on that new model
(single endpoint returning a list of recommended tracks)
